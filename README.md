    <h2>Materials
    </h2>
    <p>A non-stick pan with a clear lid, 400 grams of rice, 400 grams of water, and a stove
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions
    </h2>
    <h3>Step 1:
    </h3>
    <p> Put the rice in a large sieve, then rinse under running cold water.  Gently rub the rice between your fingers, removing the excess starch, until the water runs clear.  Drain very very well, until the last drop of water seem to have been shaken off, then transfer the rice to heavy-bottomed non-stick pot.  Add the water and give it a stir, then put on the lid (if there’s a steam-hole, block it with a small piece of damp paper-towel.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2:
    </h3>
    <p>Set the pot over the smallest flame that you can keep alive, then set the timer for 15~20 min. You should never ever boil this type of rice!  Never. By the end of the 15 min, the water should be just right on the verge of coming to a simmer but not yet.  OK?  This process warms the rice evenly, but mostly, it acts as a pre-soaking step.  At the end of this step, the rice should look swelled up, but you should still see a thin layer of water above it
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3:
    </h3>
    <p> Now turn the heat up by just a dial, then set the timer for another 10 min. This still won’t boil the water because you should never. But you will see a steady stream of steam coming out of the pot, and you may see a bubble here and there at the centre of the pot.  At 5 min, there won’t be any water visible above the rice.  At the end of the 10 min, the steam should have reduced down to a whiff, signalling that most excess water have evaporated. This is what we want.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4:
    </h3>
    <p>Now turn the heat off completely, and set the timer for another 5 min. This step completes the cooking-part of it.  By the way, you should not, by any means, open the lid… or stir the rice… or so much so as talking/disturbing the rice at any point during the entire cooking process. 
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5:
    </h3>
    <p>Finally, you can remove the lid, but careful not to drop the excess water on the lid into the rice. With wooden spoon or even wooden chopsticks, gently, and I mean gently, fold the rice from the bottom of the pot over the top (without crushing the grains), and repeat a couple more times until the rice is evenly “folded”. You may notice a small nub of rice at the bottom-centre of the pot being slightly coloured. Unfortunately this is inevitable with stove-top cooking. If you are using this rice for making sushi, remove the small nub, but if you’re eating it plain, then it doesn’t really bother anyone.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6:
    </h3>
    <p>Now, the final maturing step.  Put the lid back on and let sit for another 5 min.  If you are worried about keeping the rice warm, midway through this step, you can blast the pot over medium heat for 20 seconds to re-warm the pot.  Why do this?  You can eat the rice after STEP 5 without any trouble of course, but the rice after this extra 5 min of stand-alone time will tastes bouncier, livelier, and will take on a gentle luminous glow.
